# Create a VM with PowerShell
# Replace file destinations, computers, and users to applicable setting.
## Task 1: Configure the Cloud Shell

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). You can find your login credentials within the resources tab (directly next to this Instructions tab!).

2. From the Azure portal, open the Azure Cloud Shell by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

3. When prompted to select either Bash or PowerShell, select PowerShell.

4. On the "You have no storage mounted" screen, select **Show advanced settings** then fill in the information below:

   | **Settings** | **Values** |
   |--------------|------------|
   | Resource Group | myRGPS |
   | Storage account | cloudshell43100371 |
   | File share | shellstorage |

5. Select **Create Storage**.

   Continue to Task 2.

## Task 2: Create a Resource Group and Virtual Machine

In this task, we will use PowerShell to create a resource group and a virtual machine.

1. Ensure PowerShell is selected in the upper-left drop-down menu of the Cloud Shell pane.

2. Verify your new resource group by running the following command in the PowerShell window:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzResourceGroup | Format-Table
3. Create a virtual machine
New-AzVm `
-ResourceGroupName "myRGPS" `
-Name "myVMPS" `
-Location "East US" `
-VirtualNetworkName "myVnetPS" `
-SubnetName "mySubnetPS" `
-SecurityGroupName "myNSGPS" `
-PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIpPS" `
-SecurityType "Standard"

4. When prompted, provide the username and the password that will be configured as the local Administrator account on that virtual machine.

5. Once the VM is created, close the PowerShell session Cloud Shell pane.

6. In the Azure portal, search for Virtual machines and verify that myVMPS is running. This may take a few minutes.

7. Access the new virtual machine and review the Overview and Networking settings to verify your information was correctly deployed.

### Task 3: Execute Commands in the Cloud Shell

1. Retrieve information about your virtual machine including name, resource group, location, and status. Notice the PowerState is running.
Get-AzVM -name myVMPS -status | Format-Table -autosize
2. Stop the virtual machine using the following command:
Stop-AzVM -ResourceGroupName myRGPS -Name myVMPS
3. When prompted, confirm (Yes) to the action. Wait for Succeeded status.
4. Verify your virtual machine state. The PowerState should now be deallocated. You can also verify the virtual machine status in the portal. Close Cloud Shell.
Get-AzVM -name myVMPS -status | Format-Table -autosize

### Task 4: Review Azure Advisor Recommendations In this task, we will review Azure Advisor recommendations for our virtual machine.
1. From the All services blade, search for and select Advisor.
2. On the Advisor blade, select Overview. Notice recommendations are grouped by Reliability, Security, Performance, and Cost.
3. Select All recommendations and take time to view each recommendation and suggested actions.
## Depending on your resources, your recommendations will be different.
