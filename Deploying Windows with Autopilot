# Deploying Windows with Autopilot
# Replace Directories, Computers, Group Names, and Users to applicable setting
## Summary
In this lab you will learn how to provision a Windows 11 device with Autopilot using User-driven mode.

## Scenario
Contoso IT is planning to roll out a deployment of new Windows 11 devices using Autopilot. The devices have a default installation of Windows 11. Users should be able to connect the device, turn it on, and answer minimal questions during the OOBE, using their Azure AD credentials to sign in. The process should automatically enroll and join the Azure AD domain. You have been asked to configure and test the experience.
